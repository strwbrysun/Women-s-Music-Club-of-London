					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>From the ages of 12 to 17, I experienced firsthand the Ontario education system’s treatment of its music programs. From broken or otherwise fragile instruments that we were unable to replace, to fewer classes due to a lack of teachers, my contact with music education was politically fraught with monetary issues. In the most recent budget of 2024-2025, the education budget does not include any money allocated toward art programs <a id="footnote-1-1" href="#footnote-1-2">[1]</a>. This allows public music education to fall behind other aspects of the public-school education, exactly what many organizations exist, and existed, to prevent against.</p>
					<p>The Women’s Music Club of London, originally the Woman’s Morning Music Club, began operations in 1894, established by Louise Carling <a id="footnote-2-1" href="#footnote-2-2">[2]</a>. Inspired by clubs in other cities, it led women to organize frequent recitals to engage in performing and listening to good music. Carling noticed a gap existed in London’s cultural scene, motivating her to begin this music-centered club. Using local buildings such as churches, the executive would meet to discuss finances and plan out future events<a id="footnote-3-1" href="#footnote-3-2">[3]</a>.</p>
					<p>Women, particularly middle-to-upper class white women in the 1800s, had plenty of free time, allowing them to become involved in clubs such as this. Being barred from higher education and the public work force, subsequently being confined to the private spheres, they had to experiment with alternate forms of entertainment <a href="#footnote-4-1" id="footnote-4-1">[4]</a>. Though many children were taught to play musical instruments, as girls grew older, they were discouraged from expressing musical talent outside of their homes and family circles. Women would perform to signal that they were looking for a husband; once they were married, performance was no longer needed <a href="#footnote-5-2" id="footnote-5-1">[5]</a>. Women in the Music Club were both married and unmarried, with titles ‘Miss’ and ‘Mrs.,’ combatting this notion that women could only perform as unmarried individuals <a href="#footnote-6-2" id="footnote-6-1">[6]</a>. With women as the focus of the club, especially at the beginning, it gave them a voice by enhancing their musical education and allowing them to perform outside of their homes.</p>
					<p>The Women’s Music Club of London used their concerts to engage in different forms of advocacy, most notably increasing women’s musical education, giving members of the club and students a space to perform, raising money for local charities, and bringing famous musicians to the London, Ontario area.</p>

					<h2>Education Between the Club Members</h2>
					<p class="header">Two Etudes........................................................................................................................</p><p class="header">Chopin</p>
					<p>As women were not allowed access to post-secondary institutions, they had to find alternate methods of educating themselves. Through the recitals put on by the Women’s Music Club of London, women had given themselves increased access to music education. A select number of their earlier concerts in the late 1800s included an essay read out by a member of the organization on different topics – current musical events and women’s influence on music were two of the essays <a id="footnote-7-1" href="#footnote-7-2">[7]</a>. In increasing their awareness of musical events, they stayed connected to the public world that they were not directly involved in. Further, discussing the influence women had within music is very important – in acknowledging that women had previously made an impact on music, they simultaneously address the fact that they are also making an impact, even if only a local impact.</p>
					<p>From the beginning of the organization, they often gave themes to the concerts. These would be centered around a specific genre or country’s music, such as “dance music” or German day <a id="footnote-8-1" href="#footnote-8-2">[8]</a>. This method continued through the 1910s, with a notable recital in 1914 revolving around Canadian composers <a id="footnote-9-1" href="#footnote-9-2">[9]</a>. By performing the contributions Canadian composers have made to the musical canon, or the accepted tradition of music, they bring awareness to more local forms of music. Much of their other concerts include European forms of music, which makes this recital important in expanding the scope of their performances (see Figures <a href="#figure-1">1</a> and <a href="#figure-6">6</a> for examples of European music performed).</p>
					<p>By consistently changing the music they perform and listen to, the women of the Music Club exposed themselves to many contrasting forms of music. Hours before these recitals, they would gather to learn about the genre being performed – discussing stylistic elements such as tempo, dynamics, and harmony <a id="footnote-10-1" href="#footnote-10-2">[10]</a>. As each country makes different choices in their music, and more specifically, each composer makes different choices, by dissecting them, the women strengthened their ability to more deeply understand the music being performed. Educating themselves was an important aspect of the organization, especially during the early times when the political climate did not allow for them to hold day jobs other than being a mother.</p>
					<p>It is important to acknowledge that the music they performed was largely part of the European musical canon – narrowing their understanding of music to more palatable genres. They did not listen to other international music, which would have further expanded their knowledge of different musical cultures. However, the European canon most frequently has sheet music available, compared to other cultures that are often based on passed down knowledge <a id="footnote-11-1" href="#footnote-11-2">[11]</a>.</p>

					<h2>Active Members and their Performances</h2>
					<p class="header">Scherzo................................................................................................................</p><p class="header">Clara K. Rogers</p>
					<p>Women taking up the position of the public performer was an important aim of the club, with many joining to participate in recitals and practice their skills to ensure they did not disappear. There were two kinds of paying members of the club: associate members, typically at a rate of 2 dollars. The second type were active members, who often paid a 1 dollar fee and committed to performing during the organization’s season <a id="footnote-12-1" href="#footnote-12-2">[12]</a>. There were two groups under the Women’s Music Club of London – the Ladies’ Choral Club, originally the Women’s Morning Music Club Chorus, and the Ladies’ Orchestra <a id="footnote-13-1" href="#footnote-13-2">[13]</a>. They performed frequently throughout the season, alongside other active members who performed solo or with an accompaniment.</p>
					<p>	At the beginning of the club’s existence, concerts were more frequent and could be held during the day (see <a href="#figure-2">Figure 2</a> for reference to an afternoon concert). This makes it abundantly clear that the members of the club had many hours of time during the day to dedicate to music, which is a privilege that they had access to only because they were often not allowed to work. These weekly concerts had programs that were always organized by women – an opportunity that would otherwise not be available to them <a id="footnote-14-1" href="#footnote-14-2">[14]</a>. This made their concerts a woman-only space where women were able to be the center of attention, in contrast to other artistic ventures such as crochet <a id="footnote-15-1" href="#footnote-15-2">[15]</a>. In sharing each other’s presence, this mode of performance was revolutionary for the times – to have a women-only space to share and learn music. </p>
					<p>	As women gained access to jobs, these women-led performances became less frequent. While they did hold member concerts in the 1920s, they were less frequent than earlier years, indicating a change in the political and social climates of London, Ontario. They were still able to share their love for music and performing, but with less opportunities and more male participation. This brought their musical skills and music education to the broader community.</p>

					<h2>Enhancing Students' Learning</h2>
					<p class="header">Flower Song.........................................................................................................................</p><p class="header">Lang</p>
					<p>Being the future of every organization, students were welcomed into the Women’s Music Club of London with open arms. Student concerts were frequently hosted to ensure that they had a space to practice performing, as learning to perform is integral to a well-rounded musical education <a id="footnote-16-1" href="#footnote-16-2">[16]</a>. These concerts also functioned as a way to encourage more children to become students of music. This is a method that contemporary music educators can adopt, by increasing people’s awareness of the different styles that students can engage in.</p>
					<p>Within the constitution of the Women’s Music Club of London, the object, or the aim, of their organization always included students: “…the encouragement of student artists” <a id="footnote-17-1" href="#footnote-17-2">[17]</a>. Music organizations are often directed toward students or include them in some alternate way, and this club is no exception. With the goal of educating and increasing musical exposure for the entire community, it is understandable that the Women’s Music Club would directly involve students in some form.</p>

					<p>Including students in the proliferation of music is important to their development as students and to encourage them to continue engaging in music for the rest of their lives, whether that be at a professional or recreational level. Other than fostering a love of and engagement with music, introducing music to young children is also beneficial to early language and mathematics learning <a id="footnote-18-1" href="#footnote-18-2">[18]</a>. The club’s eager inclusion of students is a mutually beneficial relationship – the children gain musical skills and strengthen their language and mathematics skills, and the women of the club are exposed to more music they may not have heard otherwise.</p>

					<h2>Charity Concerts for Local Organizations</h2>
					<p class="header">Sonata III.................................................................................................................</p><p class="header">Mendelssohn</p>
					<p>A common advocacy activity, raising money for charity, was the goal of a handful of the concerts held by the organization. One of their first concert fundraisers was in 1928: a twilight organ recital under the guidance of the Women’s Music Club of London <a id="footnote-19-1" href="#footnote-19-2">[19]</a>. The target of financial aid was the Sick Children’s Hospital, a more local cause. During the Second World War, they held two recitals as fundraisers for the Red Cross Society. The second concert, in December of 1943, was raising money for the Prisoners of War Fund in particular <a id="footnote-20-1" href="#footnote-20-2">[20]</a>. Fundraising for the war was not as local as the hospital, however, many Canadians fought in the war. These concerts were therefore indirectly impacting London locals, in particular, those who were serving in the military.</p>
					<p>As a form of advocacy, fundraisers have been a longstanding tradition. In the United States, fundraising can trace its roots to the 1700s, with those in towns collecting aid, such as medical care, fuel, and money, to give to the less fortunate <a id="footnote-21-1" href="#footnote-21-2">[21]</a>. This eventually became more large-scale fundraising events, such as the recitals organized by the club. They encouraged community members to donate at the door and put notices in their preceding concert programs to bring awareness to the event <a id="footnote-22-1" href="#footnote-22-2">[22]</a>.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, there were few resources in the archive that detailed the monetary amount that each concert was able to collect, so their fundraising successes can only be assumed.</p>

					<h2>Musicians From Around the World Set Foot In London</h2>
					<p class="header">O thou sublime sweet evening star.........................................................................</p><p class="header">Wagner-Liszt</p>
					<p>The Women’s Music Club of London put London on the map of cities for North American and International musicians with their “Artists’ Concert” series <a id="footnote-23-1" href="#footnote-23-2">[23]</a>. This series began around the 1920s and became a prominent part of the organization’s operations until it collapsed in 1965. By the end of the club’s existence, they had mostly Artists’ Concerts, one in April and the other in October, open to any community member interested in witnessing the performance <a id="footnote-24-1" href="#footnote-24-2">[24]</a>. These performers would visit from all over Canada and the United States to play for Londoners. Though organized by the Women’s Music Club, non-members were also invited to attend. In this, they were able to increase the musical literacy and exposure of the wider community. They invited both men and women to perform, as well as child prodigies and famous musical groups. A few of these famous guests of the time include Paul de Marky, the Toronto String Quartette, and Celia Hansen <a id="footnote-25-1" href="#footnote-25-2">[25]</a><a id="footnote-26-1" href="#footnote-26-2">[26]</a>.</p>
					<p>Hosting professional musicians is important to community culture as it contributes to the artistic knowledge that community members have, and it changes children’s understanding of jobs by giving them musical role models. This makes the community sympathetic to music education in general, by giving them a sliver of the materials that would be taught to children. This introduction to music that the community gains helps keep music within school systems, an important aspect of children’s development <a id="footnote-27-1" href="#footnote-27-2">[27]</a>.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>In facilitating women’s education, carving a space for women and students to perform, raising money for charity, and increasing London’s musical literacy, the Women’s Music Club of London used concerts as an effective and diverse vehicle of advocacy. Advocacy can come in many forms, from many different people, and these women saw a gap in their own, as well as the community’s, music education, which motivated them to build a new space in the form of regular concerts.</p>
					<p>Though all these activities seem unrelated, concerts bring them together under the guidance of the women involved in the club throughout the almost 70 years it was active. The concerts were the main initiative undertaken by them, shifting through the social and cultural changes in London, Ontario. The aims of their club changed along with the climate of London, causing their concerts to shift in focus, originally being a space for women with free time during the day, eventually becoming a place for the extended community to experience music. Some of their advocacy initiatives continued for longer than others and overlapped, but overall, their concerts revolutionized alongside contemporary issues.</p>
					<p>A more subtle form of their advocacy, as a side effect of their concert advocacy, was advocating for women to be integrated more fully into public spaces. Women in Canada had been steadily increasing their involvement in the workforce since the 1950s <a id="footnote-28-1" href="#footnote-28-2">[28]</a>. The Women’s Music Club of London, in fighting for music education more broadly, also fought for women’s place in musical spaces outside of education and their homes.</p>
					<p>For music educators, the struggle to keep music in the classroom has been a long and tedious process. Many on the outskirts of education believe that music should only be for talented children, however, they are cultural pieces for every child and the Women’s Music Club treats it as such <a id="footnote-29-1" href="#footnote-29-2">[29]</a>. In music advocacy, it must be emphasized that every child is deserving of musical access regardless of their talent level or previous exposure. The Music Education Journal treats advocacy as a constant in music education, to increase benefits for everyone involved<a id="footnote-30-1" href="#footnote-30-2">[30]</a>. Though the climates are extremely different, contemporary music educations can find parallels in their advocacy struggle in the Women’s Music Club, underscoring the fact that advocacy is ongoing. In particular, the Ontario Music Educators’ Association, or OMEA, has an Equity Action Plan giving suggestions to music educators on how they can continuously advocate for increased music funding<a id="footnote-31-1" href="#footnote-31-2">[31]</a>.</p>
					<p>Contemporary music educators can also be inspired by the efforts of the Women’s Music Club through their concerts. Providing briefs on the genres or topics explored in a concert series would be a helpful place to start – encouraging people to engage deeply with the music by learning about the common conventions of the musical era. Music educators already engage in plenty of advocacy in the current times, especially with regards to government underfunding. Music education has a place in the classroom, and when looking at the Women’s Music Club of London, it is clear that this struggle has been ongoing for over a hundred years – and I hope it does not stop until music is treated as important to the student.</p>
