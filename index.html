				<h1>Concerts Strengthen Community Education: An Archival Understanding of the Women's Music Club of London</h1>
				</section>
				<section class="abstract">
				<h2>Abstract</h2>
				<p>When thinking of advocacy, concerts are not necessarily top of mind, but they can be extremely effective as vehicles of it. For about 70 years, London, Ontario had its own club that used concerts and performances as their primary advocacy project. The Women’s Music Club of London was established in 1894 and disbanded in the early 1960s. It was led by an all-female executive team and allowed women to engage in musical pursuits outside of their homes. They advocated for groups in healthcare or in support of soldiers, but they were primarily active advocates in the music education sector. Leafing through both Western’s and London’s Archives reveals the group’s underlying operations and gives a comprehensive look at many of the performances given during their existence, allowing for the background and foreground pieces of their advocacy initiatives to be seen in constellation. The importance of music education remains a debated topic in current public education systems – taking inspiration from historical music advocates can lead to new advocacy initiatives.</p>

					<h2>Catherine Walke</h2>
					<p>I am in my second year at Western studying Honors Psychology and SASAH. I love music and history – I grew up playing flute and took IB Music and History in high school. They gave me a deeper appreciation for a wider range of music and a comprehensive historical overview of musical eras throughout the centuries, allowing me to see how two of my passions overlap. My past experiences in school and my interactions with educators continue to inform the directions I take with my research.</p>
